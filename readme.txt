My graph gui can successfully add/remove points and add/remove edges. It can also calculate the BFT and DFT. My typescript shows that BFT and DFT work based on the output. When i am running BFT DFT in graph gui, the output for every edge is 5, because i set the data of every edge to be 5. The reason why i set the data to be 5 was that the addEdge method is called only once every time mousedragged/pressedmis triggered. I thought that to change the data I probably needed a loop? So I just arbitrarily set the data of all the edeges. 

Sadly my distance method didnt work. It initialized the unvisited list and the cost list correctly, but it got stuck in the while loop. after debugging, i figured that it was my lowest (the node with the lost cost) was not updated correctly. I got confused at where should i update the lowest. Cuz apparently i need to compare the cots between the neighbors, and the cost of the neighbors is the sum of the edge cost plus the previous cost (the cost of the current node). but instead i compared all the recorded cost including the cost of the current noce which was defnitely smaller than its neighbors (bc costs of neighbors are sum). but according to my way of updating the lowest, the lowest would always be the current node. I feel like if i was given more time i could have figured it out. 

For the animation part, I wantted to make the edeg change color every time its traversed. So I made setColor and getColor so that I can change the color of the edeg when the edge is added into the list in BFT DFT methods. But the changes happened too fast to be seen. And I googled that thread.sleep() can help. But then I realized it didnt work the way i wantted. :((((
